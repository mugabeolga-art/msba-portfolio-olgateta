# Individual Contribution

## What did you personally contribute to the most?

I contributed most to feature engineering and model interpretation. I helped identify meaningful predictors and translated model outputs into business recommendations.

## One decision I advocated for

I advocated for focusing on model interpretability in addition to accuracy so the retention team could take clear action based on results.

## Lessons Learned

- Predictive performance alone does not create business value.
- Feature engineering significantly impacts model quality.

If I had more time, I would test uplift modeling and refine hyperparameter tuning.
