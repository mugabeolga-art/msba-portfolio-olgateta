# TruSource Customer Churn Analysis

## Business Problem

TruSource is experiencing customer churn, which threatens long-term revenue stability. The goal of this project was to identify early behavioral and billing indicators of churn so the company can proactively intervene with targeted retention strategies.

## Key Results

- Higher monthly fees combined with no unlimited data increased churn risk.
- Short contract types were strongly associated with churn.
- Behavioral and billing features improved predictive accuracy beyond demographic variables.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the notebooks in Jupyter or your preferred IDE.
3. Install required libraries (pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, xgboost).
4. Ensure the dataset CSV is in the working directory.
5. Run notebooks sequentially.

## Limitation

Model predictions rely on historical behavior and require monitoring for drift if pricing or business policies change.
